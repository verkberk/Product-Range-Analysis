### Main steps
1. __Data Preprocessing__
    - Study type correspondence
    - Study missing values
    - Study duplicate values
    - Change data types to appropriate types
    - Remove duplicates
    - Process missing values if possible
    

2. __Exploratory data analysis__
    - Study data profile report
    - Check min, max and average values
    - Check distributions
    - Check for outlyers and nonsence values


3. __Analyse product line to determine which products to include in the main and additional assortment in order to competently offer additional products to buyers and optimize purchases.__
    - See the products price range and it's distribution  
    - See the most and the least sold products
    - See the products with the most and the least quantity purchacsed
    - See the products with most and least price per unit
    - According to previous findings determine price range categories
    - Identify if there is a seasonality: analyse if there is a change in product's sales according to season. At least for the top sales products see it's sales amounts during summer months and winter and compare results.
    - See if there are any changes for recent month or two: Does the top-sales products differ for the last month as compared to top products of the whole period? Compare results.
    - Are there any categories that can be toggled according to product's names? Like "Kids", "Kitchen ware" or any other relations that could help figure out main and additional products within each category?
    - Determine products that are more often sold by themselves and which ones are more often combined with others (main and additional assortment). Analyse customer's orders.
    - According to the groups determined above, see what product groups are more often included in the additional assortment?
    - What bundles of product groups are often present in shopping carts? For example, the category "houseplants" can often be accompanied by "mineral fertilizers".
    - Draw conclusions: what are the product groups and how they are usually combined in the orders.
    

5. __Formulate and test statistical hypotheses__
    - According to patterns found during analysis, pick out those that seem to affect the results the most and formulate the hypothesis to check.
    
    
6. __Final conclusion and recomendations__


7. __Create a presentation__
    - According to patterns found during analysis, pick out those that seem to affect the results the most and formulate the hypothesis to check.
